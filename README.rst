This is code I have created or copied and modified as I progress learning COBOL.

There are two main areas:

    OpenCobol: These are programs that were written to use the gnuCobol compiler
    MVS: These are programs that were written to run on MVS 3.8j and possibly IBM's zOS.

There will be some that are the same programs with slight modifications for the different
environments they will run in.

I am trying to create a template that would work on both with just one modification. 

We'll see how that goes.
