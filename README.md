This is code I have created or copied and modified as I progress learning COBOL.

There are two main areas:

    OpenCobol: These are programs that were written to use the gnuCobol compiler
    MVS: These are programs that were written to run on IBM's MVS 3.8j and probably zOS.

There will be some that are the same programs with slight modifications for the different
environments they will run in.
