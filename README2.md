Because I am working through multiple Tutorials, I will describe the naming conventions I am using here.

As it is my intension to move each program from PC to MVS to ZOS, this will keep the tracking of the source code easier and since I am starting on the PC, it's better to just do this at the beginning.

['Beginning COBOL for Programmers' by Michael Coughlan](http://www.apress.com/9781430262534):

Original Source: AMC0X0Y

My Source: ADS0X0Y

Where 0X is the chapter number and 0Y is the exercise number.

For example: Listing8-1.cbl becomes:

AMC0801.cbl - Original

ADS0801.cbl - My version


['The Punctilious Programmer' by David E. Woolbright ](https://punctiliousprogrammer.com/ibm-enterprise-cobol/):

Original Source: BDW0X0Y

My Source: BDS0X0Y

Where 0X is the Unit number and 0Y is the exercise number.

There is one issue with this in that he gives the programs short names already so the names I will be using don't have a direct link to the original source but I will try to follow in sequence.

BDW0101.cbl - Original

BDS0101.cbl - My version
