Because I am working through multiple Tutorials, I will describe the naming conventions I am using here.

As it is my intension to move each program from PC to MVS to ZOS, this will keep the tracking of the source code easier and since I am starting on the PC, it's better to just do this at the beginning.

['Beginning COBOL for Programmers' by Michael Coughlan](http://www.apress.com/9781430262534):

Original Source: AMC0X0Y

My Source: ADS0X0Y

Where 0X is the chapter number and 0Y is the exercise number.

For example: Listing8-1.cbl becomes:

AMC0801.cbl - Original

ADS0801.cbl - My version
